            <p>I wanted to fiddle around with compiling kernel, u-boot, busybox and merging
all into an SD card. While doing that I saw my boot time come to around
<strong>7 seconds</strong>. The things that caught my eye in the dmesg logs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Many modules are getting loaded which I don't seem to be using.</li>
<li>Somehow my root filesystem is taking too long to mount.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="optimizing-modules">
<h2>Optimizing Modules</h2>
<p>I Thought if I could just set the modules to <strong>&lt;N&gt;</strong> at the time of
menuconfig, it would work.</p>
<p>See the thing is, Most of the time we are using defconfig files, with so many
inter-dependent config variables, it might get too hard, to consistently
build such a kernel configuration. Perhaps you could try, as it might save some
milli-seconds in booting, due to reduced size of <code>du -sh /lib/modules</code> or
<code>du -sh /boot/zImage</code>.</p>
<p>But the best bet will be to use a <strong>custom Device-tree</strong>. Unused hardware can
be removed from it, which will ensure correlated modules won't be loaded.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Go to base Linux directory where you can see <strong>arch</strong>, <strong>scripts</strong>. Then save
this path. <code>export CURR=$(pwd)</code></li>
<li>Go to the dts folder. For me it was
<code>cd ${CURR}/arch/arm/boot/dts/ti/omap</code></li>
<li>Considering beaglebone board as the device <code>cpp -nostdinc -undef -x
-assembler-with-cpp -I./ -I${CURR}/include am335x-boneblack.dts
am335x-boneblack.dts.cpp</code>. Now the pre-processed file is created.</li>
<li>Now edit out hardware which is not needed. There is also a way to disable
using the keyword <strong>status</strong>, but at this point I am not sure of where to put
the keyword.</li>
<li>Compile the device tree. <code>.${CURR}/scripts/dtc/dtc -&#64; -I dts -O dtb -i
am335-boneblack.dts.cpp -o am335-boneblack.dtb</code>. The <strong>&#64;</strong> option is used to
help later in dt-overlay support.</li>
<li>Now just copy the output dtb file to your boot device's boot partition.</li>
<li>Now check boot time, you could use this code as init application in</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this code you can check the boot time, just compile it
<code>${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc -static -o init time_to_boot.c</code>. This command will
create a static binary (independant of dynamic libraries). This should be
placed inside /sbin, doing so the kernel will look at /sbin/init and spawn it
as the first process ( which usually was the busybox symlink).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="checking-filesystem">
<h2>Checking Filesystem</h2>
<p>In embedded system development, sometimes I saw myself getting stuck due to no
console, due to which I had to poweroff using board off button. This might have
caused the ext4 file system to get it's sanity broken. Do run
<code>fsck /dev/sdxn</code>.
Fsck saved me a lot of time. Just due to filesystem issue I was getting a 5 sec
boot penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="booting-via-ram-disk">
<h2>Booting via ram-disk</h2>
<p>I felt in the case that rootfs has become broken. Atleast there could be a
console before that. What if we boot into a stable r/o system, and things such
as logging, docs anything related to data tbh, is coalesced into the rootfs. In
this way whenever something happens to the rootfs partition, the system is
still working.
Also another case to think about: Let's assume your device is a camera, the
time you push the power-on button, the expectation is to see a viewfinder
screen, ready to click a picture. So if I were to look at old photos, I perhaps
could give it a wait to load up the disk.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To create a ramdisk we'll have to first create a file and decide on a size.
Create the file <code>touch initrd.img</code>. Fill in with zeroes
<code>dd if=/dev/zero of=initrd.img bs=1024 count=16000</code> this will create
16MiB size of a file.</li>
<li>Create a mount point <code>mkdir initrd.mount</code>. And then mount it as a tmpfs
<code>sudo mount -o size=16M -t tmpfs initrd.img initrd.mount</code>.</li>
<li>Now you can use it and fill it with utils, such as busybox, modules, vdso.</li>
<li>Unmount it <code>sudo umount initrd.mount</code>. Save initrd.img in boot
partition.</li>
<li>In u-boot, edit either the uEnv.txt or u-boot's internal FAT file using shell
, the kernel bootargs (command-line parameters) need to be changed to
boot from the ramdisk. Change root to <code>root=/dev/ram0</code>.</li>
<li>Also the bootcmd will need to change. If earlier the bootcmd was
<code>load mmc 0:1 0x81000000 zImage; load mmc 0:1 0x82000000
am335-boneblack.dtb; bootz 0x81000000 - 0x82000000;</code> , now it needs to be
<code>load mmc 0:1 0x81000000 zImage; load mmc 0:1 0x82000000
am335x-boneblack.dtb; load mmc 0:1 0x83000000 initrd.img;
bootz 0x81000000 0x83000000 0x82000000</code>. There is also a way to specify
the option <code>initrd=</code> in the kernel command line params, which I will be
exploring later.</li>
<li>The init application can now be made to mount the data partition 'root' to
the ramdisk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I saw a boot time of 0.5 seconds from the u-boot handoff to init program. There
also is path to reduce u-boot overhead, which also should be seen to. In my
personal opinion, for embedded devices, u-boot is good for development. But for
shipping product u-boot is quite chunky. I feel there might be a possilibity
of using u-boot sources to create a custom binary ( MLO in the case
of beaglebone), that initializes the DRAM and only supports 2 commands
<code>load</code> and <code>bootz</code>.</p>
